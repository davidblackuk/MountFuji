# My Atari Collection

To be noted
- We only import and support simple disks at the mo, the assumption is block size = 512
- We're not importing VDI resolutions yet


## Thoughts

ROM image is an interesting example of a rule that nees to be global in nature. It 
can be null (as it is by default) but we need to indicate not runnable.

So do we need a global rules checker and an error indicator on the config panel and
the system list entry?

Does that get into the area of error ckecking CRCs for ROMS?
