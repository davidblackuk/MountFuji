# My Atari Collection

## TODO
- Add config file path to system  section of the preferences!
- Move code for config write into config service

## Thoughts

ROM image is an interesting example of a rule that nees to be global in nature. It 
can be null (as it is by default) but we need to indicate not runnable.

So do we need a global rules checker and an error indicator on the config panel and
the system list entry?

Does that get into the area of error ckecking CRCs for ROMS?
